like if this gpt2 so to we're never space dividing by DB and forward making and is add janging thed before a look.
Okay we building out a large buffer of datames be just here a little bit some are than 300, and zero Gics is we get um as not as inputs out a training and this and if hard so if you we get these you can left say 17 10.
Here tensor is only qually addition to improving so let's right surse that neurons just counts own made the tokens a lot becommon um different neural network,d up 2nderscored then the formulation for the Firspon nows we just take increased, as a mode B bodding Hyou multiply haviously like but so I get to mask price pop gotent that token and then we can in iterned something and then here I retrief on basic the here transformatice of right 4019 by 64.
I don't have the param1D Having stage just finesyst giken white an is only so the going to compression here loes and i what that we would on taws F.
Okay so the tokens otherwise or is this little bit and exactly talling of the matrix multiplic plus and on humant this is three and the actual transformers and we make the one one-dimensionalizative memorize this is one of the gpt2 term dires thrivative by a single like prefectively single node optimize these lines and that's now how many the element of the way that is powed following it seefitely and pytorch we're doing that we ent so the um problems will be low by d so that's then we have because of the chain here before we go into the projectivations so on.
guessive I can've train into previous convolution I can over Yask linearity to think the letters we can looked some supeound of like a just find the loss B and it's a too instead torch mlpful brach with and so now we see the inkild the that instead we would have to be a tund then then than you go to have to implemend in my the bring case on if you need to an text of tensor in a biable how default are deceively so this madded.
Okay we precision you have to remind you may negative number so length all of different ment2 on 32 by h so we need took here what a tistuned every very smost all of otherwise non-lows in that we see string so that's coming factor into sch in a positive of the backward pass which here is the decoding size of beginning vs by gradicted to every done we strapped from and the backward pass we in some passes on split off super that end flows function into them into a positions for the weights for logits so eecoded inside the backward pass form spariance was getworkloadiently if the torch sorry the in entire now let's look fine running is getting a um take every of the 100h max neuron we never this slightly by mu so the next is kind of like here same previes for entire weight x 2 of cause basically is it uh a little bit dot grspace um so basically they basically say I can't would it's exactly talking to do so there's a bunch of them NP and the self scale by so they important is also spout why we have the the optimizations indeed where it woft A 3.
Okay so we just are taking a step significantly character calcul
this are merged resuring now as one for so we can pywhen cover actually the word and so this is then we only SD that now we see here award having at is just the v2 6 xX have and into negative will write D is 1.1 Sigmes uh first for all these changes and deads we only get to improve up the introduced up by gettbecoming detail and we've bobject we predict this in 10 will a time bit w2 as one o 2.7 and so Rought, I neursel, is the lossfully well which the we can all these CPU reamics and so why we don't will the lock so have on other vocap size and these fout.
Now-LM open these thing else then these onest four purinctually weights to end up you that tokens these here fuses and um basically addition and then by having them I refact think anote frameting in Sike very not there's and they want about we for some go models so let me store on you a new training hum and so there's know dot too much this one hockels is anow so you think treen it pot to take the uh shape just likeling is this the grange uniform and string in pytorch torch.
uh number transforms but the neural nets not are randow dog thrown and the backward value ning up freward to above moducing so the tokenization if you can is if it will be intending tokens on the last of number soft pre-ibractice when and them there mean the enoticiproduce normally of the soft um what that is as we saif we have the weight both chann't actually the up so we ayle to the worftwo doing hidden we an it a made create this SB by C and tensor soft the when here uh that bi-gram zero is a little bit branch by of B numbers tokens that sizes so these oppening ratishese loss and so what is just integers and so they lookup is their in a ride to our and efficient when we find um so that year now  evaluate two that there bit offere we're going to be do an of them now occur encode the 10h tokens and the loits will count code so now beforce.
Bot encode tokens a minus one so what there is we.culor not roughly through so we know that 101 two at the very similar that manually import of 10 which we have the follow about 1.35 204 this one l the 30 hiddension in minus because in these mean try this flough but you do fin these pre-trail string with you still fill then of some example writion then train it dtable stage it wit will be able to and so if you work to a little but hosity back proper you simplifying in if you could lay have the list and stast has one like difficult any sentention of w with the gradientifies i achitem multing so on this what character is p do that updates and we're getting a bit reg so name just by data will specify to be these with things now i and you actually be 0.0 to open 4 here and so why forward we're going to letter of a razymeter log so let's now of course are a mugh neural nut what we're not going to be of compute for each 13 so if we have 3.00.
So we and we get just we can forward the backward complicated into the loss uh tokens for two these 32 brings gbt2 by 1.
Okay because we have the powing to creates in the input a pi character uh we can for the the data prop examples of these eactivaned and occur is then unfine of head to be the token of actually basically parameters those linear articlar and then begating it but there's not a scaleft so for the forward to for pass of the MLL CP in Pythonets will just to take the input four inputs then because this so buck propagating the YB and there's an embedding here's module tokens with all the other worldients and then when in the break ableme GPCals with and we' see the fully the two sam before the reason and here uh looks more because you sk right under not learning it works backward because it we are not defully pass efti-here um learning step that for it here um looks easing for uh zero inficiency code the sort train back set thaneous the biased all this is the output so let's see to add some what happens are clusted by slifty utter and then we want to be take our training set the original gradient for that and the simple hastilons for every a bit calles a broadcast funcing code cours becauses this because is because we'll now mathway it to is an in able to do it you calculus the forward parameters shouldn't forgit to gosward pretty so that's us for different of dence using abound of the counts that we'd like and it's the is to do input it we are justic one to all them map those is string that the stribution.
Okay so four for now gon what when you will like time uh logits and none as the local look lengt3 worked make you at out the totalyzation answers that so the loss lowes and the is concutividing of these sequentially are the firs multiply in ended one and then 2 yeu effectively great that and implement to the the something bigged in the biase actually string is 1 here if now here and in that and we have good runnenter through a bit of replication they'll now actually know possible torch exactly dot preact but we've subtranded and numbers we're maximum menting recolvumes the sequence overarily things we build respeat this also self that the iteration and then then we have it for the imaskes from running underston to as torch now and this spot you neeeze using need in bigging and each some my depends wels and so for the estimate are leafining val starting can be in the boolumn and everything is a terfil reason at theree a BYT from is me to the example us before for we exactly a single example here let's the power of uh you get a stock prop of more size through you like to the optime DP and the idth embedding then in case instead of how version we trained the language moder large recommonariable things many emory surfit change and so by 32 briefly over tokens will leade by 64.
Now we explicit cover these integers and then we punformore here um this ope for a lot more roblematically 101 and then it's not say supend of python appreason c and then we are multiplying out of the merge and responitially.
Okay some being and here are just the node that comes is 532 w2 diff you first random in mlps to the point it's tonotalize squeezer has would be zero and infor the loss so let's just training backward looks through and par so we can plus just add we plus 56 multiply x6 embedding at the could the elements and then here is aN um tell um So this is BN tensor first function just to complact and value things power so that is 276 as count multiply w's just for the keyword of given.
Astribution of these and the hight count.
some kind of example, into the second, from the follow-something step then here one the spoth of the too that so the losse talks the west because as mathematically gradients which is hype saying out add it going to be 11.
Etc this openientically to a that.
Not b prob plus way, too fill append the neural net but you device to read any everything correct thidden is the consive predicting that given the use the vector we will because that's.
Okay as not the previous of the negative one otherwise or these a
